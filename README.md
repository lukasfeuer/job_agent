# Crawler for Job Portals

Work in progress 

The goal is to create an automated web crawler, targeted at APIs of specific job-portals. The script will crawl job portals, process and filter the responses, compare to the results of past runs and send an email with only the newly published positions. Since many companies use very different technologies for their job portals, this project is also meant as a continuous exercise in working with REST APIs.
